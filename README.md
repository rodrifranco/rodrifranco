## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**rodrifranco/rodrifranco** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a little project.My idea is to make a Pomodoro timer with a calendar. Maybe itâ€™s simple, but I like the idea.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and Node.js. I like learning backend frameworks, which is why I chose Node.js, but I don't know whether to choose backend or frontend.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: people usually call me Rodri
